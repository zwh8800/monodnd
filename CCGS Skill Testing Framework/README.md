# CCGS Skill Testing Framework

Quality assurance infrastructure for the **Claude Code Game Studios** framework.
Tests the skills and agents themselves — not any game built with them.

> **This folder is self-contained and optional.**
> Game developers using CCGS don't need it. To remove it entirely:
> `rm -rf "CCGS Skill Testing Framework"` — nothing in `.claude/` depends on it.

## How to use it

All testing is driven by two skills already in the framework:

### Check structural compliance

```
/skill-test static [skill-name]     # Check one skill (7 checks)
/skill-test static all              # Check all 72 skills
```

### Run a behavioral spec test

```
/skill-test spec gate-check         # Evaluate a skill against its written spec
/skill-test spec design-review
```

### Check against category rubric

```
/skill-test category gate-check     # Evaluate one skill against its category metrics
/skill-test category all            # Run rubric checks across all categorized skills
```

### See full coverage picture

```
/skill-test audit                   # Skills + agents: has-spec, last tested, result
```

### Improve a failing skill

```
/skill-improve gate-check           # Test → diagnose → propose fix → retest loop
```

## Updating the catalog

`catalog.yaml` tracks test coverage for every skill and agent. After running a test:

- `/skill-test spec [name]` will offer to update `last_spec` and `last_spec_result`
- `/skill-test category [name]` will offer to update `last_category` and `last_category_result`
- `last_static` and `last_static_result` are updated manually or via `/skill-improve`

---

## Writing a new spec

1. Find the spec template at `templates/skill-test-spec.md`
2. Copy it to `skills/[category]/[skill-name].md`
3. Update the `spec:` field in `catalog.yaml` to point to the new file
4. Run `/skill-test spec [skill-name]` to validate it

---

## Removing this framework

This folder has no hooks into the main project. To remove:

```bash
rm -rf "CCGS Skill Testing Framework"
```

The skills `/skill-test` and `/skill-improve` will still function — they'll simply
report that `catalog.yaml` is missing and suggest running `/skill-test audit` to
initialize it.
