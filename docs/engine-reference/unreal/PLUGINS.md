## On-Demand WebSearch Strategy

For plugins NOT listed above, use the following approach when users ask:

1. **WebSearch** for latest documentation: `"Unreal Engine 5.7 [plugin name]"`
2. Verify if plugin is:
   - Post-cutoff (beyond May 2025 training data)
   - Experimental vs Production-Ready
   - Still supported in UE 5.7
3. Optionally cache findings in `plugins/[plugin-name].md` for future reference
